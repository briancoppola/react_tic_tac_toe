# react_tic_tac_toe
A React-based Tic-tac-toe game

## Description

This is just a simple pass-and-play version of Tic-tac-toe, using React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The 'X' player always makes the first move (for now!). When one player wins, the status bar will announce that player's victory, and their winning pieces on the board will briefly flash in their color (CSS animation). Otherwise, the game will end in a draw.

After the game ends, a replay button appears in the status bar to offer the user a chance to reset and replay the game.
